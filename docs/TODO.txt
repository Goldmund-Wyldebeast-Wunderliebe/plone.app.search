1. Content types disabled in "Define the types to be shown in the site and
searched" field are still searchable even though they disappear from the
filter.

2. Check for unnecessary dependancies for the package (contentlisting?)

3. Fix "Search settings" (@@search-controlpanel):
    - "Advanced search form settings" should be called something like "Search
      filter settings";
    - remove "Collapse rarely used options" field - we don't collapse the
      fields in the filter.

4. Make sure protection of "Sort order of search results" works and anonymous
users don't see the 'sorter' if they are not supposed to.

5. Use "Search results per page" field's value in the view.

6. Updated description for "Sort order of search results" to list new options
for sorting.

7. As an additional bonus - filtering by section. We need a catalog of the
site's sections though so that a user could select items from what sections he
is interested in when searching.

8. RSS link should be updated in accordance to the request even when using ajax
calls.
