1. Sort out 'relevance' sort option - it is not highlighted as active after coming back to it after Ajax calls. Other options behave as they should.

2. Content types disabled in "Define the types to be shown in the site and searched" field are still searchable even though they disappear from the filter.

3. Move Selenium tests into separate folder in order to avoid running them in the general testing process of the package.

4. Check for unnecessary dependancies for the package (contentlisting?)

5. Fix "Search settings" (@@search-controlpanel):
    - "Advanced search form settings" should be called something like "Search filter settings";
    - remove "Collapse rarely used options" field - we don't collapse the fields in the filter.

6. Make sure protection of "Sort order of search results" works and anonymous users don't see the 'sorter' if they are not supposed to.

7. Use "Search results per page" field's value in the view.

8. Updated description for "Sort order of search results" to list new options for sorting.

9. As an additional bonus - filtering by section. We need a catalog of the site's sections though so that a user could select items from what sections he is interested in when searching.
