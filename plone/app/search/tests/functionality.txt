Basic usage
======================

First of all we need some initial content for it to appear in the search:

  >>> from plone.testing.z2 import Browser

  >>> app = self.layer['app']
  >>> portal = self.layer['portal']

  >>> browser = Browser(app)
  >>> browser.open('http://nohost/plone/@@search?SearchableText=spam')
  >>> '<strong id="search-results-number">100</strong>' in browser.contents
  True

First of all, let's test the sorting options.
When we get search results for the first time, they should be sorted by
relevance:

  >>> '<strong>relevance</strong>' in browser.contents
  True
